    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Team members who are high on delivery and motivation are usually very serious about career progression and are always looking at opportunities to contribute more to the company and have a greater impact on the products. However, it&rsquo;s never easy for an individual to figure out once he joins a team or a company as to how he will grow and how does his job become complex. It&rsquo;s also important that a company promotes a culture where expectation setting and career progression are not just at the will of manager&rsquo;s but there is a clear articulation of what the company values and it promotes a culture which thrives on those values. If the goal is to define career progression for a function in a lean way, so that a single sheet could give a bird&rsquo;s eye view of what are some of the key tactical, strategic and behavioral expectations, you could follow a similar process to come up with a version which aligns to your companies requirements.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>While career progression sometimes may end up being a conversation around working on broader technologies or an opportunity to work on a new project but in the long term it&rsquo;s not a fundamental progression. As you gain skills and maturity, its important that the team members reflect the same through their roles, responsibilities and behaviors consistently so that the company as a whole benefits in achieving it&rsquo;s goals. Below is a sample template for a developer track which could be used to define career progression at any organization, with what you value at which level in your organization.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/banding_template.png" title="[600] [400] [[A template for developer career progression]]" ></p>

<h2>Some of the key highlights</h2>

<blockquote><ul>
<li>Contribute &ndash; If you noticed, the document is heavily loaded with &ldquo;Contribute&rdquo; because we feel no matter what you are and what you do, you are always contributing and producing work on your own. If you are a company with a lot of people whose job is to generate and assign work to people, you probably have a very undesirable DNA.</li>
<li>As you move from left to right, you gain and demonstrate the evolution of different competencies consistently.</li>
<li>Irrespective of which level or job you belong to, you do not want to restrict disruption. Disruption is not limited to rolling at a new feature, there are many ways and means of disrupting the status quo and you should always be emphasizing to your teams to be disruptive to change the status quo.</li>
<li>Innovation should not be one man/function/team job. Everybody should be empowered to innovate. Some companies have separate teams whom they call innovation teams, which itself conveys a message to other&rsquo;s &ndash; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine if you are not innovating.&rdquo;. Do you really want to do that ?</li>
<li>There is a clear stress on courage, as you don&rsquo;t want to have people in your team who only do what is told to them but never challenge or bring up issues.</li>
<li>As you move from left to right on your career axes you are becoming strategic and also handling much more complexity to come up with solutions. A healthy mix of levels in a company will automatically help achieve it&rsquo;s goals in a more cohesive way.</li>
<li>There is no stress on process or adherence to a process, because process is suppose to empower you to do what is desired.</li>
<li>You want to make sure that people just don&rsquo;t move up the ladder because they have been in the company for a couple of years. For instance if they are not demonstrating the desired principal contributor competencies, then it&rsquo;s pretty public to everyone and you would not need to deal with the politics.</li>
<li>Fast movers would love such a setup as irrespective of their experience or when they joined the company, they clearly know as to what the company values and this is not a conversation that he/she needs to have with his/her manager every now and then.</li>
<li>It doesn&rsquo;t matter what is your current experience, or how long you have been in a level, if you are consistently demonstrating the next level, you make progress and it doesn&rsquo;t put off anyone because it&rsquo;s all public.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>However, before you get to define such a framework it&rsquo;s important to step back and answer a few key questions.</p>

<h4>* Do you promote a culture which helps people make progress in their career and be more accountable without any politics or is your company run at whims of manager&rsquo;s/lead&rsquo;s who decide what they value and who demonstrates it ? If you are not open to supporting it from the top, the above experiment will be detrimental.</h4>

<h4>* What are some of the key competencies that you value, and how do they evolve over time ? Ideally you may not want to pick more than 5 key competencies. If you are not clear about this, you will never be able to retain your ninja&rsquo;s for a long time.</h4>

<h4>* Do you have a clear convergence across roles, so that company is able to meet it&rsquo;s goals with combined efforts from employees.</h4>

<h4>* You may have to break the standard practices of importance of industry experience and hierarchy as it may only be indicative but in no way require you to mandate someone to be X years of experience before he can be a Principal Contributor. If someone can be a principal contributor in half the time as other&rsquo;s you are actually in good company.</h4>

    <link href="http://vjhawar.github.io/blog/2012/03/08/quickly-setup-a-hiring-workflow/"/>
    <updated>2012-03-08T10:30:21+05:30</updated>
    <id>http://vjhawar.github.io/blog/2012/03/08/quickly-setup-a-hiring-workflow</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hiring the right talent, at the right time with the right resources is key to any companies success. If you are not able to get your hiring plans on track and ensure that you are always hiring great people, it&rsquo;s going to get very challenging for you both internally and externally. I still feel hiring is still a lot of art than science and it needs a lot of focus and priority to get it right. While each company has it&rsquo;s own hiring strategy on the kind of talent it wants to pursue, it always helps to follow a lean hiring process which can move fast and be responsive to a candidate. If you really like someone, you should be able to seal the deal pretty quickly, rather than linger on due to process and productivity issues in your hiring team.</p>

<p>One way to keep focus and priority on hiring is to make it transparent to all the stakeholders and participants. Most interviewers hate it when all they are told to just conduct an interview when a candidate arrives as if their job is just to do a round of intreview and then spit out the feedback. If you end up creating silos among your interviewers and decision makers, you will hardly make any good progress in hiring because each interviewer feels his job was just to do the interview and provide feedback. An interview should not just be an evaluation for a candidate, it should be an experience and if the interviewer treats it as a monotonous task, the candidate is not going to be excited about it. The best way is to open up the hiring details and progress to everyone and ensure that everyone who is part of hiring team is involved in the complete process and gets a complete update on where things stand. If we are not making progress on a key hire for a team A, and it&rsquo;s imperative we add capacity to Team A this quarter as we have over arching goals to achieve in this year, you need more partners to help you reach the goal then just executors who will do a task assigned to them. Hiring fails badly when it gets task oriented, so it&rsquo;s best to align each interviewer as a partner in your hiring process.</p>

<p>A quick way to setup a simple workflow for hiring would be to use JIRA, if you are already using it in your company for an engineering project. JIRA is very powerful and you can quickly setup any custom workflow with required permissions in minutes and boom you are ready to go without buying any new fancy software. Setting up a kanban board in JIRA is a quick hack to get your hiring process transparent and ensure real time tracking of progress made on any position.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="/images/hiring_flow.png" title="[728] [90] Hiring on kanban" ></p>

<h4>What do you do</h4>

<ul>
<li>Setup a Kanban board for recruiting. A sample reference screenshot is shown above.</li>
<li>Create columns as per your companies hiring process, each stage in the interview process would typically be a column on the board and you could have some additional columns to see specific status such as &ldquo;Resumes Rejected&rdquo;, &ldquo;Offer Dropouts&rdquo; as this are some areas you want to focus on if they have big count. If so, it requires a strategic intervention to get things right.</li>
<li>You could create swimlanes for each position or a group of positions. This will help you see progress by each position or group. For e.g. in the screenshot above, we are tracking two separate positions.</li>
<li>Define filters on top as per your requirements. These could be By location, By date, By state, By date range etc.</li>
<li>Setup an email such that any resume that comes in the company is sent to a JIRA project and depending on how you have structured your swimlanes it will autmatically land in the INBOX column for that psition.</li>
<li>Have a meeting among the hiring team members, and set the rules of the game. Every body checks and assigns the tasks as per workflow, and updates the feedback on the JIRA task assigned to them.</li>
</ul>


<h4>How does it help</h4>

<ul>
<li>If any particular particiapting function or person is bottleneck in the current pipeline, it would instantly show up on the board.</li>
<li>If you are seeing too many offer dropouts, you know something is wrong.</li>
<li>If you are seeing too many resumes getting rejected, it means your sourcing is not right and your team is spending valuable time on rejecting resumes.</li>
<li>If your scheduling or initial screening is blocking the progress, you can now ask difficult questions to your talent partners.</li>
<li>Having the whole activity being updated in real time helps everyone in the team and you don&rsquo;t end up doing useless meetings on tracking status. Also, each task has an assignee at any moment of time and people know what is coming along their way next.</li>
<li>With everybody&rsquo;s comments on the task, its easy to reach a decision.</li>
<li>People come up with ideas in order to solve bottlenecks in the pipeline because now they may feel part of the process rather than being a hop in the process as was happening previously.</li>
</ul>


<p>If you are not using JIRA, you could also use Asana to setup a quick hiring workflow for your team as per &ndash; [Recruiting and applicant tracking] (<a href="https://asana.com/guide/explore/workflow/customize">https://asana.com/guide/explore/workflow/customize</a>)</p>

<p>Ensuring a lean and transparent process using some productive tools can go a long way in helping you hire the right talent. If you are not being productive in hiring, you will end up wasting more time of your key engineers on interviewing more people than deliver products because there is a high chance that the candidate you liked has been shortlisted by some more companies and if you are not tracking and moving fast, you will lose a great potential hire whom your team really wanted on board.</p>
